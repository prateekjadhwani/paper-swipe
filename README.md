# paper-swipe

`paper-swipe` provides enables swipe gestures to swipe content to either the left or the right to unveil the underlay
behind it.

Example:

    <paper-swipe disable-swipe>Swipe Gestures disabled</paper-swipe>
    <paper-swipe left-swipe>Only Left Swipe</paper-swipe>
    <paper-swipe right-swipe>Only Right Swipe</paper-swipe>
    <paper-swipe on-tap-underlay='tapHandler'>Tap Event Handler</paper-swipe>

`paper-swipe` allows user to use the custom DOM in the body to create basically any contents and it has two different
sections which allows the customization by using the `content` and `underlay` attributes:

Example:

    <paper-swipe>
      <div underlay>Underlay content goes here...</div>
      <div content>Content of swiping element goes here...</div>
    </paper-swipe>

### Event handling

`paper-swipe` has been added some features to fire certain events such as `tap-underlay` and `edge` so that user can
make use of it to perform additional functions as you like:

Example:

    <paper-swipe on-edge="edgeHandler">
      <div underlay>Underlay content goes here...</div>
      <div content>Fire `edge` event when the panel is at the edge of the screen...</div>
    </paper-swipe>

    <paper-swipe on-tap-underlay="tapHandler">
      <div underlay>Underlay content goes here...</div>
      <div content>Fire `tap-underlay` event when the panel is being clicked...</div>
    </paper-swipe>
